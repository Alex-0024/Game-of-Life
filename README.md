Game of Life
Rules of the game:
A dead cell becomes alive if there are exactly three living cells next to it.
If a living cell is surrounded by two or three living cells, then that cell remains alive.
Otherwise the cell becomes dead.
If there is not a single living cell left on the field or no changes occur, the game ends.

Before starting the game you need to:
- select speed from 1 to 500
- select fill density (2 is the highest)
- select a game mode (you can add your own modes to the functions init_Map)

IMPORTANT: select the correct size of the console window before starting the game.
The repository contains 3 executable files with different console window sizes
